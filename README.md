Hi! This is a demonstration on how to Automate a Web Application using Selenium Webdriver. 
1. To run this automation test case you need to install Eclipse. Here's a link to the site . http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/keplersr1
2. Once Eclipse is installed you need to import the project.
3. This can be done a couple of different ways depending on your preference.
4. Once the project is imported you can run the test by right clicking on GhostModule.java and selecting Run As TestNG Test
5. A report will be generated in the report file after the test has been ran and has a breakdown of the setup and the steps that were taken.
If you have any questions or comments feel free to email me at cates.chad@gmail.com
Thanks and Happy Testing!!
